# Wildlife-Strikes-on-Aircraft-Analysis-Dashboard
### Dashboard Overview
The Wildlife Strikes on Aircraft Dashboard, developed using Tableau, provides a detailed analysis of trends, patterns, and impacts of wildlife strikes on aircraft. It offers insights into strike timing, geographical hotspots, economic consequences, and species involvement. The dashboard empowers stakeholders with actionable information to improve aviation safety and mitigate risks effectively.

### Key KPIs and Metrics

1. Total Incidents Over Time:
	- Tracks the steady increase in wildlife strike incidents from 1993 to 2023, highlighting the growing risk.

2. Seasonal Trends and Strike Timing:
	- Analyzes incidents by month, with peak activity in July and August.
	- Breaks down strikes by time of day (day, night, dawn, and dusk) to uncover behavior-driven patterns.

3. Geographic Hotspots:
	- Maps high-risk airports across the U.S., with Denver International Airport reporting the highest number of incidents.

4. Species and Aircraft Involvement:
	- Highlights commonly involved species like gulls and unknown birds.
	- Identifies the most impacted aircraft models, including A-320 and B-737, and the associated damage levels.

5. Economic and Operational Impact:
	- Evaluates repair costs over the years, with a significant spike in 2009.
	- Measures downtime and flight disruptions caused by wildlife strikes, such as aborted take-offs and precautionary landings.

### Customer Risk Analysis Report

Based on the analysis and insights provided by the dashboard, several key areas of concern and actionable insights are identified:

1. At-Risk Airports and Flight Phases:
	- Geographical and operational insights allow prioritization of resources to mitigate risks at high-impact airports and vulnerable flight phases like take-off and landing.

2. Species-Based Risk Assessment:
	- Larger bird species are associated with more severe damage. Risk mitigation strategies can be tailored to manage these species near hotspots.

3. Operational Improvements:
	- Understanding strike timing can inform scheduling and visibility-related measures to minimize incidents.

### Key Findings and Recommendations

1. Proactive Wildlife Management:
	- Implement geo-specific strategies, such as radar-based detection systems and habitat modifications, at high-risk airports like Denver International.

2. Seasonal and Time-Specific Strategies:
	- Enhance preventive measures during peak months (July and August) and high-risk times (daytime).

3. Focused Species Mitigation:
	- Devise targeted strategies to manage larger birds and species frequently involved in strikes to minimize severe damage.

4. Data-Driven Decision Making:
	- Leverage insights from the dashboard to optimize resource allocation, improve incident reporting, and implement adaptive policies.

### Key Objectives and Goals

- Reduce High-Risk Incidents: Implement detection systems and wildlife management programs at identified hotspots.
- Optimize Resources: Focus on high-risk flight phases and geographical locations.
- Minimize Repair Costs: Prioritize mitigating incidents involving larger bird species to reduce damage severity.

By utilizing these insights, aviation stakeholders can significantly enhance safety measures, reduce operational disruptions, and minimize the financial impact of wildlife strikes on aircraft.
