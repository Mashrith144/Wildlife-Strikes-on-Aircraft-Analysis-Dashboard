# Wildlife-Strikes-on-Aircraft-Analysis-Dashboard
### Dashboard Overview
The Wildlife Strikes on Aircraft Dashboard, developed using Tableau, provides a detailed analysis of trends, patterns, and impacts of wildlife strikes on aircraft. It offers insights into strike timing, geographical hotspots, economic consequences, and species involvement. The dashboard empowers stakeholders with actionable information to improve aviation safety and mitigate risks effectively.

### Key KPIs and Metrics

	- Breaks down strikes by time of day (day, night, dawn, and dusk) to uncover behavior-driven patterns.

3. Geographic Hotspots:
	- Maps high-risk airports across the U.S., with Denver International Airport reporting the highest number of incidents.

4. Species and Aircraft Involvement:
	- Highlights commonly involved species like gulls and unknown birds.
	- Identifies the most impacted aircraft models, including A-320 and B-737, and the associated damage levels.

5. Economic and Operational Impact:
